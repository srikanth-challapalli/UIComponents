   <div id="main-heading"><h1>Main Heading </h1></div>
   <div class="sub-heading"><h2> Sub Heading </h2></div>
   <p> The Main Heading uses id attribute to uniquely identify the division of html. So corresponding css file will identify this selector with "#" followed by id value. Where as Sub Heading uses "class" attribute to uniquely identify the divison of html. So corresponding css file will identify this selector with "." followed by class value. When working with Css styles we normally use classes as css selector."id" should only be used when you want to use that "id" in javascript function. As per standards, "id" should be maintained as unique value across web application and "class" can be duplicated whenever you want to replicate same styling across web application. Another important point to note while using id or class as selector is within class we can apply multiple styling seperated by space.Where as, while using id we only provide only one stylying class </p>
