        <p>If I would like to change the color of the text which is present inside header only. Then I will use the styling as "header&lt;space&gt; p " tag then all the paragraphs which are inside header will change their color to red .</space></p>
        <h1 class = "main-logo">Main Logo</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="Home">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="About Us">About Us</a></li>
            <li><a href="Contact Us">Contact Us</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you would like to apply any styling for entire page then we use universal selection . The systax is pretty simple "*{}" inside the folwer brackets anything you put that will be applicable for entire page in which the respective stylesheet file is included. Normally this tag will be used for fonts so that the page will be looking symmetric. In our example I applied style to change the entire page text color to blue. However, if someone wish to override this they would be able to do it by specifying the selector and provide the styling. In this example even we applied the universal selector as to change the text color to blue. There is another styling applied to this page to make all the paragraphs which are present inside header to change the text color as red. So we are witnessing the change in header paragraphs as red.</p>

        <h2>Main content of our web page </h2>
        <section class="my-article">
            <h2>Article Section --If you wish to change the color of the heading "Article Section" to dark ping , without changing remaining headings color within section tag then we have to use a selector "section.myarticle >h2 { color : darkpink} this will allow only immediate heading to change the color. The "&gt;" symbol will allow to change the color of immediate html element. if the "&gt;" is not provided then under section all the h2 headings will change the color to pink.</h2>
